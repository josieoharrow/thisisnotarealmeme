# thisisnotarealmeme

A Generative Adversarial Network trained to create memes.

## Data ##

Real data to train the GAN will be collected by scraping images of memes off the internet. All images will be downsampled to a standard size of 100 px x 100 px.

## Experiments ##

Our first approach to this problem may not be effective. Particularly because we couldn't find any examples of successful GANs that generated images with words in them. This section will keep track of the network configurations we use, hyperparameters, etc. until we find something that works so that others can follow our work.

### Experiment 1 ###

Machine learning architecture: "Vanilla" DCGAN
Hyperparameters: 
Other Meta Data:
